A gentle wave motion on a single moving head with a warm static color and low‑intensity ping‑pong will support the vocals without overpowering the calm atmosphere, following the 60‑70% sync rule for breathing room."

A single moving head with a gentle rotate keeps the stage alive without over‑stimulation, providing a subtle warm wash that supports the lingering vocals while respecting the 60‑70% sync rule."
