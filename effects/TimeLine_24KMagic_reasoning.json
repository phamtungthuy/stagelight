The audio is medium‑energy but the overall section is a calm fade‑out, so a dramatic VFX or strobe would break the resolution; we need a subtle, low‑intensity motion to keep the performer highlighted. Because the lyrics “Look out!” are a brief repeat, the light can simply follow the vocal with a gentle rotate or wave on a single moving head, keeping intensity low and color cool to match the intro haze. This provides breathing room while still supporting the final line, satisfying the rule to leave 30‑40 % of beats empty and to avoid constant strobe or pyro in an outro.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"effects\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"SINGLE_LIGHT\",\n      \"motion\": \"Rotate\",\n      \"intensity\": \"low\",\n      \"color\": \"cool\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Lyrics repeat “Look out!”, a neutral phrase that does not call for dramatic lighting.  \n4. Neighboring beats (215‑220) are also medium‑energy repeats; the following beat (222.55) drops to low energy, indicating the final exit from the song.  \n5. According to the outro convention (Rule 2), we should **fade intensity** and not introduce strobe or VFX.  \n6. The beat should therefore be left **silent / minimal** to give breathing room and support the gradual fade‑out.\n\n**Result**\n\n```json\n{\"effects\": []}\n```"

The audio shows medium energy, high‑band dominance, and a drop in brightness, indicating a gradual fade‑out rather than a peak.  \n3. The lyrics are still present, so the lighting should support the vocals without overpowering them.  \n4. The surrounding beats are also medium‑to‑low energy, so maintaining a subtle movement keeps the breathing room that rule 1 (60‑70 % active beats) and rule 3 (no constant strobe) require.  \n5.
